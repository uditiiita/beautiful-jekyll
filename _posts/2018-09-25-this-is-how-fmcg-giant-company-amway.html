<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">As technology becomes more and more mature, every company now wants to have an online presence so that they can sell their products to an entirely new online segment. Today, almost every company have their online website. But the focus they give to the security of their website is very minimal or close to zero.<br /><br /><h4 style="text-align: left;">Issue I found:</h4>Almost a year back, I found an issue in <a href="http://www.amway.in/store/">Amway</a>. Amway is a very big FMCG company which sells products in various categories ranging from health to beauty. The issue I found was allowing me to order from their website without actually making any payment.<br />I ordered some random product and actually received it at my address. Just to be clear, yes, I did not pay for this product which I received at my address.<br />Picture of the order I got for free:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-lzDYijjY3GQ/W6okcjGg_cI/AAAAAAAALXE/-OJTKIHOpxUGezsty7WZxvB2U5pxfk_swCLcBGAs/s1600/amway-issue.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1040" data-original-width="780" height="320" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-lzDYijjY3GQ/W6okcjGg_cI/AAAAAAAALXE/-OJTKIHOpxUGezsty7WZxvB2U5pxfk_swCLcBGAs/s320/amway-issue.jpeg" width="240" /></a></div><br /><h4>What did I do after I found this?</h4>I reported this issue to Amway via email. 2 days after I reported this, I got a response that their technical team will look into this and will fix this. But nothing happened. I checked after a month and the bug was still there. I kept checking for it and the bug continued to be there.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-XryqOBN2fkI/W6ok_hJR7iI/AAAAAAAALXM/mW9KdT4S0uQq8xolHpXVb_7zg4__5aGzACLcBGAs/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2018-09-25%2Bat%2B5.37.06%2BPM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1075" data-original-width="1600" height="429" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-XryqOBN2fkI/W6ok_hJR7iI/AAAAAAAALXM/mW9KdT4S0uQq8xolHpXVb_7zg4__5aGzACLcBGAs/s640/Screen%2BShot%2B2018-09-25%2Bat%2B5.37.06%2BPM.png" width="640" /></a></div><br /><br />After around half a year, in Feb 2018, I tweeted to them to check if they are going to fix the bug or not but that tweet also went unanswered.<br /><br /><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><div dir="ltr" lang="en">This is very unfortunate how careless such big companies are for their tech. They have a vulnerability in their payments system and they don't care about it at all. I guess I should make that vulnerability public.

But nothing happened.<br /><br />Today (i.e., 25th September, 2018) again, I checked for it and again I am able to make an order for free.<br />I know its SAD but <b>YES, THE BUG IS STILL THERE</b>.<br /><br />I still hope that Amway will see this blog post atleast and will get the issue fixed.<br />Lets hope and work for a <b>MORE SECURE INTERNET.</b><br /><br /></div>
